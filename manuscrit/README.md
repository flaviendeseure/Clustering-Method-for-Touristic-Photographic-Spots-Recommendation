## Abstract
With the soaring popularity of digital photography, it is becoming increasingly explicit that tourists cannot go on vacation without a camera. Tourism and photography have become very complementary, and tourists are constantly seeking the best spots to capture pictures and memorize their vacations. However, the search for the best and unforgettable photographic spots is difficult and time-consuming for tourists, especially during visits new regions. In this paper, we propose a method for discovering tourist photo spots from geotagged photos using double clustering algorithms. A recommendation system is build based on knowledge extraction from the clusters. The approach is simulated and experimentally evaluated on a real photographic dataset of the French capital $Paris$. Our approach identifies the best-known spots in the reference websites, and also quirky or thematic spots.
